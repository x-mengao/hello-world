## Welcome to Xiaomeng Gao's GitHub Pages

Let me try texting like **Read.ME** taught.
Adding "**" or "__" in front of and behind a word or string will make the font **bold**.<br/>
Example #1. My name is **Xiaomeng Gao**. I am from the **People's Republic of China**.
Example #1. My name is __Xiaomeng Gao__. I am from the __People's Republic of China__.

Adding "*" or "_" in front of and behind a word or string will make the font *italic*.<br/>
Example #2. My name is *Xiaomeng Gao*. I am from the *People's Republic of China*.
Example #2. My name is _Xiaomeng Gao_. I am from the _People's Republic of China_.

Now, let me try some weblinks. To add a link withing the text, following format has to be obeyed. 
first, [] includes the site name you want people to click on, which will turn blue in Preview mode. Immediately after it, put the link within a pair of brackets ().<br/>
Example #3. My name is **Xiaomeng Gao**. Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ev56Ug0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [LinkedIn Professional Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaomenggao/) for more details.

Now, let me try **numbered** lists. 
Example #4. I have tried the following syntaxes:
1. make font bold
2. make font italic
3. add a weblink to external site

I can also try listing **bullets** with a single "*" sign in front **(! nothing behind)** of the text
Example #5. I have tried the following syntaxes:
* make font bold
* make font italic
* add a weblink to external site

Alternatively, one can use _solid dots_ and _hollow dots_ to list items with layer. - works as layer one, another - starting at a tab away is layer two. Such as
Example #6. I have visited the following _states_/_cities_ with the **US**
- Hawaii
  - Honolulu
  - Haleiwa
  - Kaneohei
  - Mililani
  - Wa'ahiwa
  - Hilo
  - Kailua-Kona
- Arizona
  - Phoenix
  - Goodyear
- California
  - Los Angeles
  - San Diego
  - San Francisco
  - Davis
  - Sacramento
  
The list goes on...
